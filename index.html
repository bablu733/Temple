                        He watched them closely for the next few days and when the next full moon rose, he decided to
                        become
                        a Guru. The Adiyogi transformed himself into the Adi Guru; the first Guru was born on that day
                        which
                        is today known as Guru Purnima. On the banks of Kanti Sarovar, a lake that lies a few kilometers
                        above Kedarnath, he turned South to shed his grace upon the human race, and the transmission of
                        the
                        yogic science to these seven people began. The yogic science is not about a yoga class that you
                        go
                        through about how to bend your body – which every new born infant knows – or how to hold your
                        breath
                        – which every unborn infant knows. This is the science of understanding the mechanics of the
                        entire
                        human system.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para1">
                        After many years, when the transmission was complete, it produced seven fully enlightened beings
                        –
                        the seven celebrated sages who are today known as the Saptarishis, and are worshipped and
                        admired in
                        Indian culture. Shiva put different aspects of yoga into each of these seven people, and these
                        aspects became the seven basic forms of yoga. Even today, yoga has maintained these seven
                        distinct
                        forms.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para1">The Saptarishis were sent in seven different directions to different parts of the
                        world
                        to carry this dimension with which a human being can evolve beyond his present limitations and
                        compulsions. They became the limbs of Shiva, taking the knowing and technology of how a human
                        being
                        can exist here as the Creator himself, to the world. Time has ravaged many things, but when the
                        cultures of those lands are carefully looked at, small strands of these people’s work can be
                        seen,
                        still alive. It has taken on various colors and forms, and has changed its complexion in a
                        million
                        different ways, but these strands can still be</p>
                    <p class="para1">
                        The Adiyogi brought this possibility that a human being need not be contained in the defined
                        limitations of our species. There is a way to be contained in physicality but not to belong to
                        it.
                        There is a way to inhabit the body but never become the body. There is a way to use your mind in
                        the
                        highest possible way but still never know the miseries of the mind. Whatever dimension of
                        existence
                        you are in right now, you can go beyond that – there is another way to live. He said, “You can
                        evolve beyond your present limitations if you do the necessary work upon yourself.” That is the
                        significance of the Adiyogi.

                                    and Sadhguru. It is based in the foothills of Velliagiri mountains and is a part of
                                    Isha Yoga Center. In front of the statue in a mandapam, sadhguru has also
                                    consecrated a yogeshwara linga.
                                    Adiyogi is the originator of yoga. From Sanskrit, adi means "first" and
                                    yogi refers to a practitioner of yoga. According to yogic philosophy, Shiva is not
                                    only a Hindu god, but the first yogi and the first guru. Hence, he is also called
                                    Adiyogi or Adiguru.</p>
