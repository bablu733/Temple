                    He watched them closely for the next few days and when the next full moon rose, he decided to
                    become
                    a Guru. The Adiyogi transformed himself into the Adi Guru; the first Guru was born on that day
                    which
                    is today known as Guru Purnima. On the banks of Kanti Sarovar, a lake that lies a few kilometers
                    above Kedarnath, he turned South to shed his grace upon the human race, and the transmission of
                    the
                    yogic science to these seven people began. The yogic science is not about a yoga class that you
                    go
                    through about how to bend your body – which every new born infant knows – or how to hold your
                    breath
                    – which every unborn infant knows. This is the science of understanding the mechanics of the
                    entire
                    human system.

                    After many years, when the transmission was complete, it produced seven fully enlightened beings
                    –
                    the seven celebrated sages who are today known as the Saptarishis, and are worshipped and
                    admired in
                    Indian culture. Shiva put different aspects of yoga into each of these seven people, and these
                    aspects became the seven basic forms of yoga. Even today, yoga has maintained these seven
                    distinct
                    forms.
                </p>
                <p class="para1">The Saptarishis were sent in seven different directions to different parts of the
                    world
                    to carry this dimension with which a human being can evolve beyond his present limitations and
                    compulsions. They became the limbs of Shiva, taking the knowing and technology of how a human
                    being
                    can exist here as the Creator himself, to the world. Time has ravaged many things, but when the
                    cultures of those lands are carefully looked at, small strands of these people’s work can be
                    seen,
                    still alive. It has taken on various colors and forms, and has changed its complexion in a
                    million

                    The Adiyogi brought this possibility that a human being need not be contained in the defined
                    limitations of our species. There is a way to be contained in physicality but not to belong to
                    it.
                    There is a way to inhabit the body but never become the body. There is a way to use your mind in
                    the
                    highest possible way but still never know the miseries of the mind. Whatever dimension of
                    existence
                    you are in right now, you can go beyond that – there is another way to live. He said, “You can
                    evolve beyond your present limitations if you do the necessary work upon yourself.” That is the
                    significance of the Adiyogi.

                        and Sadhguru. It is based in the foothills of Velliagiri mountains and is a part of
                        Isha Yoga Center. In front of the statue in a mandapam, sadhguru has also
                        consecrated a yogeshwara linga.
                        Adiyogi is the originator of yoga. From Sanskrit, adi means "first" and
                        yogi refers to a practitioner of yoga. According to yogic philosophy, Shiva is not
                        only a Hindu god, but the first yogi and the first guru. Hence, he is also called
                        Adiyogi or Adiguru.</p>
